# Python for CLV

We can use [Python](https://www.python.org) for Customer Analytics as well. While is not the goal of this course, we will provide an alternative example. In each of the sessions, you can check and practice some examples.

## Activate environment

First we must active the previously create environment for this course:

``` 
mkvirtualenv ca
``` 

## Lifetimes installation

Now we can install [lifetimes](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes), a package that will help us to measure the CLV.

``` 
pip3 install lifetimes
``` 

## How to use the notebook.

Copy the notebook and the data folder in your environment folder. Then start Jupiter.
