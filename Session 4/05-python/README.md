# Python for CLV

We can use [Python](https://www.python.org) for Customer Analytics as well. While is not the goal of this course. In each of the session you can check and practice some examples.

## Activate environment

First we must active the previously create environment for this course:

``` 
mkvirtualenv ca
``` 

## Lifetimes installation

Now we can install [lifetimes](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes), a package that will help us to measure the CLV.

``` 
pip3 install lifetimes
```
