# Exercises

The executive team comes to you for advice. You have received cohort data for the last three years in the file "s9-homework.xlsx".

Answer the following questions:

- Analyze the cohorts.
- Can you identify any patterns?
- The team is planning 105% yoy growth (Y5 +5%) in Y6. Is this plausible given the previous information?

> Note: load the file using the library readxl and the function read_xlsx() using the right path for the file. I strongly recommned to use the janitor library and the clean_names() before start working on the questions.
