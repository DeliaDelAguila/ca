## Using Python for RFM

We can use [Python](https://www.python.org) for RFM analysis as well.

## Activate environment

First we must active the previously create environment for this course:

```
workon ca
```
And place this jupyter notebook (and the data set) in your folder.

## Required packages

Only in case you don't have them previously.

```
pip3 install pandas
```

# How to use the notebook.

Copy the notebook and the data folder in your environment folder. Then start Jupiter.
